# Introduction
This is a repository to learn-by-doing the basics of Git and GitHub.
I already used GitHub during my M1 internship just to access a script that I used for data analysis, but I never used the app Git.
I'm looking forward to learning more about Git and GitHub.

# Presentation of my motivation to learn Python, R and Git.
What motivates me to learn Python, R, and Git , first is to be as independent as possible with these software programs. Then i find that it's an advantage on a CV or when finding a job. For Git, I'm not a coding professional, so it's important to be able to share my work and benefit from the advice and help of others.
And of course, I love fry my brain in front of my computer even if i don't understand what i do.
