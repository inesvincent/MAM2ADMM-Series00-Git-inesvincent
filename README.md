# Introduction
This is a repository to learn-by-doing the basics of Git and GitHub.
I already used GitHub during my M1 internship just to access a script that I used for data analysis, but I never used the app Git.
I'm looking forward to learning more about Git and GitHub.

# Presentation of my motivation to learn Python, R and Git.
What motivates me to learn Python, R, and Git , first is to be as independent as possible with these software programs. Then i find that it's an advantage on a CV or when finding a job. For Git, I'm not a coding professional, so it's important to be able to share my work and benefit from the advice and help of others.
And of course, I love fry my brain in front of my computer even if i don't understand what i do.

# What I learned:
Git and GitHub allow you to keep track of changes made to your script and add explanations to help you remember them. This also allows you to share your work with others and collaborate. The main commands used are commit message, commit to..., push, create pull request, and merge commit.

I spent about 4 hours on this work
